			<p>This data science project is inspired by <a href="https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/">
				Matt Daniels' awesome post</a>.
				My goal was to replicate his findings with Spanish-speaking rappers.
				The first step of the project was to create a corpus of lyrics from a number of preselected artists.
				For this purpose, TextFileGenerator.java and WebCrawler.java scrape the site <a href="https://www.musica.com">
					https://www.musica.com</a> for an artist's lyrics and store them in a .txt file. TextFileGenerator
				makes use of <a href="https://jsoup.org/">Jsoup</a> to parse and remove unwanted HTML.
				The module remove_lang.py polishes our data with the use of the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/langdetect/">
					langdetect</a> library by removing lyrics in
				foreign languages such as English or Portuguese, which would artificially inflate an artist's word count.
				The file is then processed with python's <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a> library. The module
				analyse.py creates Text objects for each file and performs a simple tokenizing process to retrieve the
				unique word counts for each artist, which are then sorted in ascending order. Both .py files
				require python 3. The results are then saved to results.csv and plotted with the <a href="https://c3js.org/">C3 JavaScript library</a>
				using code from the following repository as a template:
					<a href="https://github.com/huyle333/graphs-from-csv">https://github.com/huyle333/graphs-from-csv</a>.
